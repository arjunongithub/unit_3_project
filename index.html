            <h1>You come home from a soccer game, your team loses, and you are very tired. All you want to do is go to your room and lay on your bed. Your home isÂ  quiet. When you open your room's door, you see a weird-looking machine. It says "time travel machine" in bad handwriting. You decide to go inside due to your curiosity. The door shuts, and you can't get out. Two buttons appear in front of you, one saying future and the other saying past. Which one do you choose?</h1>
        </div>

        <!-- Change the text of the buttons to the options relevant to your story. -->

            <button class="option-one">Future</button>

            <h1>You decide to go to the future. You set the year to 2079. It looks vastly different. It looked like a utopia, but there was a problem: there were no humans in sight, only robots and drones. What happened?</h1>

            <h1>You decide to go to the past, but you realize that you must be very careful with your actions since every action could alter your current reality. You set the year to 1777. You are in a military camp. The soldiers look at you weirdly since you are dressed weirdly. Due to your amazing history knowledge, you realize that you were in an American camp during the Revolutionary War. Here is the problem: On this particular day, you are wearing a shirt with the U.K. flag. Not good.</h1>

            <h1>The robots quickly turn hostile toward you and start attacking you. Since you're so awesome, you tornado-kick one of the robots, causing it to shut down. The other robots get scared and run away. You realize that this place isn't a friendly environment and head back to the time travel machine, but the machine doesn't seem to exist anymore. It dissapeared. You are stuck here. A robot spots and sends some sort of signal to the other robots. You are encircled by these hostile robots.Not Good. </h1>

            <h1>The soldiers perceive you as an enemy and collectively charge at you with their bayonets. You reason with them, and they hear you out. You explain that you are not hostile and aren't British and that you were captured but escaped from a British camp. The soldier takes you to their commander, named "General Horatio Gates." He says that in order to prove your loyalty, you are to be enlisted as a soldier and fight alongside American soldiers. Now you're stuck fighting in a war.  </h1>
